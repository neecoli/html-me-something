      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I followed a nontraditional route to get here.  I've always enjoyed the STEM
         fields.  In high school, I aspired to be an astronaut.  A lofty goal, and
         failing eyesight starting in 7th grade, I came back to earth and studied engineering
         and chemistry instead.  With my thirst for knowledge and ambition, I then
         went into healthcare, taking my core problem solving skills to a new arena.
         During my journey, I served proudly in the military, alongside the nation's finest
         Sailors and Marines.

      <p>Along the way, I've realized that I still enjoy numbers, analyzing data,
        the technical aspects of problem solving.  This led me back to my engineering
        roots, and into LaunchCode to learn the latest core programming and data science
        skills, which can be used in any industry to build things better.
