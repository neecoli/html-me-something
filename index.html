          <p>Welcome to the Greener Pasteurs! <br>
          This is my journey to coding. Enjoy!</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I followed a nontraditional route to get here.  I've always enjoyed the STEM
          fields.  In high school, I aspired to be an astronaut.  A lofty goal, and
          failing eyesight starting in 7th grade, I came back to earth and studied engineering
          and chemistry instead.  With my thirst for knowledge and ambition, I then
          went into healthcare, taking my core problem solving skills to a new arena.
          During my journey, I served proudly in the military, alongside the nation's finest
          Sailors and Marines.

            <br>
          <p>Along the way, I've realized that I still enjoy numbers, analyzing data,
          the technical aspects of problem solving.  This led me back to my engineering
          roots, and into LaunchCode to learn the latest core programming and data science
          skills, which can be used in any industry to build things better.
